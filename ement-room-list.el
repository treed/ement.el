;;; Commentary:

;; This library implements a room list buffer.

;; NOTE: It doesn't appear that there is a way to get the number of
;; members in a room other than by retrieving the list of members and
;; counting them.  For a large room (e.g. the Spacemacs Gitter room or
;; #debian:matrix.org), that means thousands of users, none of the
;; details of which we care about.  So it seems impractical to know
;; the number of members when using lazy-loading.  So I guess we just
;; won't show the number of members.

;; TODO: (Or maybe there is, see m.joined_member_count).

;; NOTE: The tabulated-list API is awkward here.  When the
;; `tabulated-list-format' is changed, we have to make the change in 4
;; or 5 other places, and if one forgets to, bugs with non-obvious
;; causes happen.  I think library using EIEIO or structs would be
;; very helpful.

  ;; ‚Ä¢ CONTENTS is a vector with the same number of elements as
